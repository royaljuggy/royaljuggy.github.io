Welcome to my Personal React Website! To be updated as time goes one.

My website's base is from: https://youtu.be/G-Cr00UYokU, the first ever React tutorial I've watched :)!

Due to the weird state of how I set up this project, I'm going to let this be my 'dev' repo, while my 'https://github.com/royaljuggy/royaljuggy.github.io' repo will be 'prod'!

In the future, once my website is up-to-date, I'll return to a classic dev/prod branch styling!
