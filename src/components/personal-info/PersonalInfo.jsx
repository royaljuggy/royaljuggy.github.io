            <p>Sportswise, I mainly watch basketball, and of course my team is the Raptors. I also sometimes watch hockey, but being a Leafs fan is tragic tale... That said, my favourite sport by
                far is curling! In highschool, I played vice-captain and captain. Alongside my teammates, we won regionals and qualified for provincials twice!</p>
            <p>I am a huge Anime geek. Ask me for my MyAnimeList profile if you'd like (albeit I personally
                believe
                I haven't watched <em>too much</em> yet). My favourite shows are
                Re:Zero, Violet Evergarden, and the Fate series. I'm a huge sucker for the genres of isekai,
                action, and romance - oh! And I absolutely love underground, less-known shows. Something about finding a series no one has heard of and learning to love it is amazing.
                I also own a very large figurine collection!</p>
            <p>I also absolutely love playing video games! My all-time favourite is CS:GO, but I also regularly
                play
                League of Legends, Pok√©mon GO, and Fate Grand Order. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> My CS:GO inventory is valued at over $1250 USD!
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, I love listening to music. The moments when I'm in my "zone" are always when I'm jamming
                out
                to my playlist. You'll find me listening to very niche genres:
                J-pop, Anime music, and a bit of K-pop. If you ever get the chance to meet me, I'd love to show
                you
                the hidden gems that is Japanese music. So please ask me to!
