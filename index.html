			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>Hello! My name is Jacob Meksavanh and I am currently a computer science undergraduate student at the University of Waterloo. 
				I am actively seeking an internship or co-op position.</p>

			<h2>My skills</h2>
			<p>I am currently working through Scrimba's <em>The Frontend Developer Career Path</em> which is teaching me HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and much more. 
			Currently, I have completed modules 1 and 2 (intro to HTML/CSS and JavaScript)</p>
			<p><strong>Racket programming knowledge.</strong> This includes a lot about recursion, binary trees (BTs and BSTs), graphs, and lists.</p>
			
			<h2>Current projects</h2>

			<h2>Awards, accomplishments, distinctions</h2>
			<h2>My hobbies</h2>
			<p>Sportswise, I enjoy occassionally watching the Raptors or Maple Leafs. But, my favourite sport to play is curling! In highschool, I played vice-captain and captain.
				Alongside my teammates, we qualified for provincials twice!
				I am a huge Anime geek. Ask me for my MyAnimeList profile if you'd like (albeit I personally believe I haven't watched <em>too much</em> yet). My favourite shows are
				Re:Zero, Violet Evergarden, and the Fate series.
				Lastly, who would have guessed, I love playing video games too. My all-time favourite is CS:GO, but I also regularly play League of Legends, Pok√©mon GO, and Fate Grand Order.
			</p>
