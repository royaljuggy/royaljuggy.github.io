					<p>Sportswise, I enjoy occassionally watching the Raptors or Maple Leafs. But, my favourite sport by far is curling! In highschool, I played vice-captain and captain.
						Alongside my teammates, we qualified for provincials twice!</p>
					<p>I am a huge Anime geek. Ask me for my MyAnimeList profile if you'd like (albeit I personally believe I haven't watched <em>too much</em> yet). My favourite shows are
						Re:Zero, Violet Evergarden, and the Fate series. I'm a huge sucker for the genres of isekai, action, and romance. I also have a very large figurine collection.</p>
					<p>I also absolutely love playing video games! My all-time favourite is CS:GO, but I also regularly play League of Legends, Pokémon GO, and Fate Grand Order.
						<strong>Fun fact:</strong> My CS:GO inventory is valued at over $750 USD!
					</p>
					<p>Lastly, I love listening to music. The moments when I'm in my "zone" are always when I'm jamming out to my playlist. You'll find me listening to very niche genres:
						J-pop, Anime music, and a bit of K-pop. If you ever get the chance to meet me, I'd love to show you the hidden gems that is Japanese music. So please ask me to!
